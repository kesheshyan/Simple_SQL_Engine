# JavaScript Simple SQL Engine
It's a very basic and not stable JavaScirpt SQL engine. You may use it as an example for something more complex, but frankly I don't recommend use it at all (seriously, by any means). It's just a proof of concept and it was built for solving a kata with the same name on http://codewars.com
